A social media website that aims to provide users with a place to find hobbies, share media about their hobbies, or find ways to participate in their hobbies.


This intends to serve as a foundation for a multi-use social media platform, allowing users to share images of their hobbies or even sell/buy equipment related to the hobby. 

## Goals ##
- A survey that gives users the best individual feedback possible. 
- Groups for each hobby where users can interact with others.
    - Visual feed for users to post images or videos
    - Marketplace for users to sell and buy equipment (low priority)
- Easily accessible literature/media/guides/articles for each hobby
    - This could easily be configured by the user, giving them the choice to prioritize the media they'd like to see for each hobby. 
- Simple Method for users to teach their skills/hobbies to other users, possibly paid (low priority)
